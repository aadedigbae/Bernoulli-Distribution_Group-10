The Bernoulli distribution is one of the simplest and most fundamental probability distributions. It describes a random experiment that has exactly two possible outcomes: success or failure. The distribution is defined by a single parameter, ( p ), which is the probability of success in one trial.

While it's often described in terms of one trial, understanding the Bernoulli distribution is the foundation for grasping more complex distributions like the Binomial distribution (which models multiple independent Bernoulli trials).

Characteristics of the Bernoulli Distribution:
Binary outcomes: The result of a Bernoulli trial can only be one of two possibilities (typically coded as 1 for success, and 0 for failure).
Single parameter ( p ): The probability of success, with the complementary probability ( (1 - p) ) being the probability of failure.
Single trial: A Bernoulli distribution models just one trial, and weâ€™re interested in whether it results in success or failure.
